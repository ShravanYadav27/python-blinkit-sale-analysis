Blinkit Sales Data Analysis
# Project Summary (For Resume & GitHub)
This is a data analysis project using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib. I analyzed sales data from Blinkit (an online grocery delivery app) to understand product performance, customer ratings, and how sales are affected by store location, size, and type of products.

# Project Objective
To clean, explore, and visualize Blinkit's sales data to get useful insights that can help improve business decisions — like which products sell best and what customers prefer.

# Key Metrics I Analyzed (KPIs)
Total Sales – Total revenue earned from all items

Average Sales – Average sales per product or category

Number of Items Sold – Total quantity sold

Average Rating – Average customer rating for products

# Charts I Created Using Matplotlib
Total Sales by Fat Content – To check which fat content type sells more (Donut Chart)

Total Sales by Item Type – To see which product category performs best (Bar Chart)

Fat Content by Outlet for Sales – Compare sales across stores by fat content (Stacked Column Chart)

Sales by Outlet Establishment Year – To check if older stores sell more (Line Chart)

Sales by Outlet Size – To analyze if bigger outlets earn more (Pie Chart)

Sales by Location – To see which cities or areas shop more (Bar/Funnel Chart)

# Tools & Libraries Used
Python

Pandas – For data cleaning and manipulation

Matplotlib – For data visualization
